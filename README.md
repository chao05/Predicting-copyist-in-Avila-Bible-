This project is about predicting copyists from the given ten features. The dataset is from UCI repository. The dataset and its associated description can be found here. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Avila

The data from 'avila_tr.txt' has been studied to train the model, while the data from 'avila_ts.txt' is available for validating the model constructed in this notebook.
The model constructed in this project is able to achieve a 100% performance score measured by 'f1' although only one feature is used.
